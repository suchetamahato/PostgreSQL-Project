# DIGITAL MUSIC STORE DATA ANALYSIS USING POSTGRESQL

In this project, I used SQL queries to analyze a digital music store's data. I did various tasks like finding the most experienced employees, figuring out the top customers, and discovering popular music genres in different countries. For example, I found the most senior employee based on their job title and identified countries with the most invoices. I also determined the top 3 invoice values and which city had the best customers. Additionally, I identified the best-spending customer. To do all this, I wrote specific SQL queries that provided valuable insights into the database.

# Questions and Answers

ðŸ”Ž **Q1: Who is the senior most employee based on job title?** 

SELECT title, last_name, first_name 
FROM employee
ORDER BY levels DESC
LIMIT 1

I found the most senior employee by retrieving their job title, last name, and first name from the "employee" table. I sorted the results by the "levels" column in descending order, assuming it indicates seniority, and limited the output to one row using LIMIT 1.

ðŸ”Ž **Q2: Which countries have the most Invoices?**

SELECT COUNT(*) AS c, billing_country 
FROM invoice
GROUP BY billing_country
ORDER BY c DESC

To determine the countries with the most invoices, I counted the number of invoices for each billing country from the "invoice" table. I grouped the results by billing country and displayed them in descending order of invoice count.

ðŸ”Ž **Q3: What are top 3 values of total invoice?**

SELECT total 
FROM invoice
ORDER BY total DESC

I identified the top 3 highest invoice amounts by selecting the "total" column from the "invoice" table and sorting the results by "total" in descending order.

ðŸ”Ž **Q4: Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. 
Write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoice totals. 
Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals**

SELECT billing_city,SUM(total) AS InvoiceTotal
FROM invoice
GROUP BY billing_city
ORDER BY InvoiceTotal DESC
LIMIT 1;

I evaluated which city had the best customers by calculating the sum of total invoice amounts for each billing city. I grouped the results by billing city, sorted them by the sum of invoice totals in descending order, and limited the result to one row.

ðŸ”Ž **Q5: Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. 
Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money.**

SELECT customer.customer_id, first_name, last_name, SUM(total) AS total_spending
FROM customer
JOIN invoice ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
GROUP BY customer.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spending DESC
LIMIT 1;

To find the customer who spent the most money, I joined the "customer" and "invoice" tables on the "customer_id" column. I calculated the total spending for each customer, sorted the results by total spending in descending order, and displayed the customer who spent the most money.

ðŸ”Ž **Q6: Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. 
Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.**

Method 1:

SELECT DISTINCT email,first_name, last_name
FROM customer
JOIN invoice ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
JOIN invoiceline ON invoice.invoice_id = invoiceline.invoice_id
WHERE track_id IN(
	SELECT track_id FROM track
	JOIN genre ON track.genre_id = genre.genre_id
	WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
)
ORDER BY email;


Method 2:

SELECT DISTINCT email AS Email,first_name AS FirstName, last_name AS LastName, genre.name AS Name
FROM customer
JOIN invoice ON invoice.customer_id = customer.customer_id
JOIN invoiceline ON invoiceline.invoice_id = invoice.invoice_id
JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoiceline.track_id
JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
ORDER BY email;

I provided two methods to find this information. Both methods involved joining multiple tables like "customer," "invoice," "invoiceline," "track," and "genre." They filtered for tracks with the genre name "Rock" and retrieved customer details for those who purchased such tracks. The results were ordered alphabetically by email.

ðŸ”Ž **Q7: Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. 
Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.**

SELECT artist.artist_id, artist.name,COUNT(artist.artist_id) AS number_of_songs
FROM track
JOIN album ON album.album_id = track.album_id
JOIN artist ON artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
GROUP BY artist.artist_id
ORDER BY number_of_songs DESC
LIMIT 10;

I identified the top 10 rock bands/artists based on the count of their rock songs. I joined the "track," "album," "artist," and "genre" tables to filter for rock songs. Then, I grouped the results by artist and counted the number of songs for each, selecting the top 10 artists based on the count of their rock songs.

ðŸ”Ž **Q8: Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. 
Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first.**

SELECT name,miliseconds
FROM track
WHERE miliseconds > (
	SELECT AVG(miliseconds) AS avg_track_length
	FROM track )
ORDER BY miliseconds DESC;

I selected track names and their lengths (in milliseconds) for tracks longer than the average track length. To calculate the average track length, I used a subquery. The results were sorted by song length in descending order.

ðŸ”Ž **Q9: Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent.**

WITH best_selling_artist AS (
	SELECT artist.artist_id AS artist_id, artist.name AS artist_name, SUM(invoice_line.unit_price*invoice_line.quantity) AS total_sales
	FROM invoice_line
	JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
	JOIN album ON album.album_id = track.album_id
	JOIN artist ON artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 3 DESC
	LIMIT 1
)

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, bsa.artist_name, SUM(il.unit_price*il.quantity) AS amount_spent
FROM invoice i
JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
JOIN invoice_line il ON il.invoice_id = i.invoice_id
JOIN track t ON t.track_id = il.track_id
JOIN album alb ON alb.album_id = t.album_id
JOIN best_selling_artist bsa ON bsa.artist_id = alb.artist_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
ORDER BY 5 DESC;

I used a common table expression (CTE) named "best_selling_artist" to find the artist who earned the most based on invoice line data. Then, I joined multiple tables in the main query to calculate how much each customer spent on the best-selling artist. The results were grouped by customer and artist, and the total spending was ordered in descending order.

ðŸ”Ž **Q10: We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the most popular genre as the genre 
with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where 
the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres.**

Method 1- Using CTE:

WITH popular_genre AS 
(
    SELECT COUNT(invoice_line.quantity) AS purchases, customer.country, genre.name, genre.genre_id, 
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer.country ORDER BY COUNT(invoice_line.quantity) DESC) AS RowNo 
    FROM invoice_line 
	JOIN invoice ON invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
	JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
	JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
	JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
	GROUP BY 2,3,4
	ORDER BY 2 ASC, 1 DESC
)
SELECT * FROM popular_genre WHERE RowNo <= 1

Method 2- Using Recursive:

WITH RECURSIVE
	sales_per_country AS(
		SELECT COUNT(*) AS purchases_per_genre, customer.country, genre.name, genre.genre_id
		FROM invoice_line
		JOIN invoice ON invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
		JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
		JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
		JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
		GROUP BY 2,3,4
		ORDER BY 2
	),
	max_genre_per_country AS (SELECT MAX(purchases_per_genre) AS max_genre_number, country
		FROM sales_per_country
		GROUP BY 2
		ORDER BY 2)

SELECT sales_per_country.* 
FROM sales_per_country
JOIN max_genre_per_country ON sales_per_country.country = max_genre_per_country.country
WHERE sales_per_country.purchases_per_genre = max_genre_per_country.max_genre_number;

I provided two methods, one using a CTE and another using a recursive CTE, to calculate the most popular genre for each country based on the number of purchases. The results showed only the top genre(s) for each country.

ðŸ”Ž **Q11: Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. 
Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. 
For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount.**

Method 1- using CTE:

WITH Customter_with_country AS (
		SELECT customer.customer_id,first_name,last_name,billing_country,SUM(total) AS total_spending,
	    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY billing_country ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC) AS RowNo 
		FROM invoice
		JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
		GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
		ORDER BY 4 ASC,5 DESC)
SELECT * FROM Customter_with_country WHERE RowNo <= 1


Method 2- Using Recursive:

WITH RECURSIVE 
	customter_with_country AS (
		SELECT customer.customer_id,first_name,last_name,billing_country,SUM(total) AS total_spending
		FROM invoice
		JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
		GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
		ORDER BY 2,3 DESC),

	country_max_spending AS(
		SELECT billing_country,MAX(total_spending) AS max_spending
		FROM customter_with_country
		GROUP BY billing_country)

SELECT cc.billing_country, cc.total_spending, cc.first_name, cc.last_name, cc.customer_id
FROM customter_with_country cc
JOIN country_max_spending ms
ON cc.billing_country = ms.billing_country
WHERE cc.total_spending = ms.max_spending
ORDER BY 1;

I presented two methods, one using a CTE and another using a recursive CTE, to determine the customer who spent the most on music for each country. The results displayed the top-spending customer(s) for each country.
